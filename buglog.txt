  1) destructElement, "ptr->T()" --> "ptr->~T()" (just typo)
  2) deleteBlock, added "delete (!!!)reinterpret_cast<void*>(p->pdata)" (forgot this)
  3) MAIN BUG: deleteObject, swapped freeListPop and destructElement" (changed data by hands before accureate deleteing)

17.03.2021, mm.h:
  1) deleteBlock, in case of deleting filled elements mask of filled was added to call destructors on each filled element
